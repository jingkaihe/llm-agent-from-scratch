    "# Build an LLM Agent from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like magic when you witness AI agents autonomously viewing files, making edits, executing commands, and working around errors. However, under the hood, the core loop is surprisingly simple: it runs a continuous cycle that takes user input, generates tool calls and text output, receives feedback from tool execution, feeds the result back to the LLM, and repeats. The complexity lies not in any orchestration, but in the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of the frontier labs' large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demystify this magic, we'll implement a simple CLI-based coding agent in Python that can read files, write content, edit text, and execute shell commands. Don't worry if you're new to AI agents - this tutorial is designed to be approachable and practical. You'll be amazed at how much you can accomplish with surprisingly little code.\n",

Install uv\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\\n\\n# If you are on macOS\\nbrew install uv\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Install Python (if needed)\\n\\nIf you don't have Python installed, uv can install it for you:\\n\\n```bash\\nuv python install\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Initialize the Project\\n\\nClone the repository and navigate to the project directory, then sync the dependencies:\\n\\n```bash\\nuv sync\\n```\\n\\nThis will:\\n- Create a virtual environment at `.venv`\\n- Install all project dependencies from `pyproject.toml`\\n- Lock the dependencies in `uv.lock`\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- **pydantic**: Data validation using Python type annotations\\n- **anthropic**: Official Python SDK for Anthropic's Claude API\\n- **jupyter**: Interactive notebook environment\\n- **pyyaml**: YAML parser for configuration files\\n- **mcp**: Model Context Protocol for extensible tool integrations\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n### Basic Usage\\n\\nTo run the full example:\\n```bash\\nuv run main.py\\n```\\n\\nTo open the main notebook:\\n```bash\\nuv run jupyter notebook llm-agent-from-scratch.ipynb\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** You can also manually activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` if preferred, but it's not required when using `uv run`.\\n\\n### MCP Server Configuration\\n\\nThe agent supports extending functionality through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. You can configure MCP servers using a `mcp.yaml` file in the project directory.\\n\\n#### Configuration Format\\n\\nCreate a `mcp.yaml` file in the project root with the following structure:\\n\\n```yaml\\nservers:\\n  server_name:\\n    command: command_to_run\\n    args:\\n      - \\\"arg1\\\"\\n      - \\\"arg2\\\"\\n    env:\\n      ENV_VAR: value\\n```\\n\\nEach server is identified by a unique name (e.g., `github`, `filesystem`) and tools from that server will be prefixed with `mcp__server_name__`.\\n\\n#### Configuration Options\\n\\nEach MCP server can be configured with:\\n- **command**: The executable to run (e.g., `npx`, `uvx`, `docker`)\\n- **args**: List of arguments to pass to the command\\n- **env**: Environment variables as key-value pairs (optional)\\n\\n#### Example Configurations\\n\\n**GitHub Server (using Docker):**\\n```yaml\\nservers:\\n  github:\\n    command: docker\\n    args:\\n      - \\\"run\\\"\\n      - \\\"--rm\\\"\\n      - \\\"-i\\\"\\n      - \\\"-e\\\"\\n      - \\\"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\\\"\\n      - \\\"ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\\\"\\n    env:\\n      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: null  # Set via environment variable, will be prompted if not set\\n```\\n\\n#### Fallback Behavior\\n\\nIf no `mcp.yaml` file is found, the agent will start without MCP servers (local tools only).\\n\"\n",

Claude Sonnet models in particular exhibit **persistent, relentless and infectiously optimistic** problem-solving behavior.

    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process Spawning**: When the Toolbox is initialized, it spawns each MCP server as a separate subprocess using the configuration from `mcp.yaml`. Each server runs with its own command (e.g., `npx`, `uvx`, `docker`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **JSON-RPC Communication**: The HAL agent communicates with MCP servers through their standard input/output streams using JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol:\n",
    "   - `initialize`: Handshake to establish connection\n",
    "   - `list_tools`: Discover what tools the server provides\n",
    "   - `call_tool`: Execute a specific tool with parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Discovery**: During startup, the Toolbox queries each MCP server to get its available tools. These tools are combined with local tools into a unified schema that LLM can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tool Execution**: When Claude requests a tool execution:\n",
    "   - The Toolbox checks if it's a local tool or MCP tool\n",
    "   - For local tools: Executes the Python function directly\n",
    "   - For MCP tools: Sends a JSON-RPC `call_tool` request to the appropriate MCP server and waits for the response\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Lifecycle Management**: The Toolbox uses async context managers to properly:\n",
    "   - Establish mcp servers connections on agent start up \n",
    "   - Clean up and close all MCP server processes when exiting\n",
    "\n",

    "## Why You Probably Don't Need MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "While MCP offers elegant standardisation, that [mcp server proliferation](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/essential-reading-august-2025#less-is-more-the-hidden-costs-of-mcp-server-proliferation) creates a \"tragedy of the commons in your context window\". Everyone wants their tool included, but the cumulative effect makes the AI assistant worse, not better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Window Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "Every MCP server and tool consumes precious tokens from your LLM's limited context window. Our GitHub example above exposed 90 tools to the agent—that's 90 tool schemas taking up space that could be used for actual code, documentation, or reasoning. This creates a trade-off: adding more tools means less space for the work that actually matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Allocation Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Less is more. The more you allocate into the context window of an LLM… the worse the outcomes you're going to get.\" — Geoffrey Huntley\n",
    "\n",
    "Each additional tool increases cognitive overhead for the LLM. With too many options, the model must spend reasoning capacity deciding *which* tool to use rather than focusing on solving your actual problem. This paradoxically makes the agent less effective, not more capable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Proliferation Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple similar tools create non-deterministic behavior. When you have overlapping capabilities (like Github MCP's `read_file` alongside the custom tool's `read_file`), the LLM struggles to choose between them. This confusion leads to:\n",
    "- Inconsistent tool selection across similar tasks\n",
    "- Wasted reasoning tokens evaluating redundant options\n",
    "- Unpredictable agent behavior that's hard to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Nightmares\n",
    "\n",
    "Third-party MCP servers introduce supply chain risks and potential attack vectors. Malicious actors could inject context that manipulates AI behavior, creating a new class of security vulnerabilities:\n",
    "- Unvetted code running with your agent's permissions\n",
    "- Potential for prompt injection through tool descriptions\n",
    "- Enterprise compliance issues with unaudited dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Better Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start with custom tools first.** As this tutorial demonstrates, implementing tools is surprisingly straightforward—just a few lines of Python with the `@tool` decorator. Custom tools give you:\n",
    "- Full control over functionality and security\n",
    "- Minimal context window overhead (only what you need)\n",
    "- Easy debugging and maintenance\n",
    "- No external dependencies or supply chain risks\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you must use MCP:**\n",
    "- Limit servers to essential, irreplaceable functionality\n",
    "- Prefer first-party integrations from trusted vendors\n",
    "- Consider dynamically enabling/disabling servers based on specific workflow stages rather than loading everything at once\n",
    "- Regularly audit which tools are actually being used and remove the rest\n"

    "## Wrap up\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the full example in `main.py`. Our AI agent `HAL` weighs in at just over 300 lines of code, yet it can read files, write content, make precise edits, and execute shell commands. The power comes not from complex orchestration, but from the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of current-generation LLMs combined with a simple, well-structured tool interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this agent can solve real-world problems, it's still in its infancy. There is a lot of grunt work needed to make it very useful, such as [better prompts](https://github.com/jingkaihe/kodelet/blob/main/pkg/tools/bash.go#L39-L167), human and LLM friendly output formatting, [sub-agent orchestration](https://github.com/jingkaihe/kodelet/blob/main/pkg/tools/subagent.go), conversation persistency & forking, image recognition and multi-llm support. The remarkable aspect is that with proper guidance, the agent can evolve and extend itself."
